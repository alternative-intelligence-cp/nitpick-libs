# The board

**Live state.** What each stream is working on, what is claimed, what is
blocked, what is done. The durable plan is
[`WORKSTREAMS.md`](WORKSTREAMS.md); the past is [`RECORD.md`](RECORD.md).

> **The orchestrator owns this file** (W-8). An agent working a stream does not
> edit it — the orchestrator claims before a worker is dispatched and releases
> when the stream leaves the repository. That is what keeps two agents out of
> one repository and removes every merge conflict by construction.

the author's session continuing the execution of `meta/roadmap/0.2/` (cloud
id `session_011Ens7KaDohzYsQU2YGyTxu`), which took the lock from the planning
session `19afbe0e-…` after it ended with its work committed (`02d4f61`). One
writer here (W-16, P-19): if this names a session that is not you, do not
write in this repository.
**Phase:** planning complete; the working system is being made to run
(cycle 0.2); library implementation not started.

## Legend

| State | Means |
|---|---|
| `—` | not started, not claimed, nothing blocking it |
| `CLAIMED sN` | stream N owns this repository; the in-flight table says what it is doing |
| `BLOCKED on <repo> <cycle>` | cannot start until that cycle is DONE; the reason is always a named cycle, never "waiting" |
| `DONE` | every cycle closed and archived to `done/` |

---

## In flight

| Stream | Repository | Subcycle | Agent label | Since | Model | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | — | — | — | — | — | nothing in flight |

## Claim protocol

1. The orchestrator writes `CLAIMED sN` against the **repository** in its
   stream table — a stream owns the whole repository while it works on it
   (W-7) — and a row in the in-flight table naming the subcycle, the agent
   label (`s<N>-<pkg>-<cycle>.<sub>-<HHMM>`), the time and the model. One
   commit: `board: claim <repo> <cycle>.<sub> for sN`.
2. One worker works that subcycle (W-15). When it reports, the verifier runs
   (W-21).
3. On PASS the in-flight row advances to the next subcycle. At a cycle's
   close the claim advances to the repository's next cycle if its gate is
   ready, else to its next ungated cycle (W-9), else it is released and the
   row removed: `board: release <repo>`. Then check whether any `BLOCKED`
   row just became free.
4. A claim with no live agent in the current session is stale — the
   orchestrate skill's recovery procedure runs before any dispatch (W-19).

**A claim is a commit.** The history of this file is the record of who worked
what and when, which is the thing the compiler's R8 says the orchestrator owns.

## Stream 1 — text

| # | Repository | Cycles | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `nitpick-regex` | 0.0 … 1.0 (16) | — | independent; nothing gates it |
| 2 | `nitpick-tui` | 0.0 … 1.0 (18) | — | independent. Inherits stream 1's Unicode approach from `nregex` |
| 3 | `nitpick-logview` | — | `BLOCKED on nitpick-tui 0.14` | repository not created; created at `ntui` 0.15's open (T-115) |

## Stream 2 — data

| # | Repository | Cycles | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `nitpick-time` | 0.0 … 1.0 (10) | — | independent. Smallest first item; finishes early and can take slack |
| 2 | `nitpick-parse` | 0.0 … 1.0 (15) | — | independent |
| 3 | `nitpick-conflint` | — | `BLOCKED on nitpick-parse 0.11` | repository not created; created at `nparse` 0.12's open (PA-103) |

## Stream 3 — system

| # | Repository | Cycles | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `nitpick-sockets` | 0.0 … 1.0 (12) | — | independent |
| 2 | `nitpick-posix` | 0.0 … 1.0 (14) | — | **O-N6 answered 2026-09-03 by probe 02** — negatively, and the repository absorbed it (PX-100: `failsafe` is generated). W-1 is discharged. Nine of its cycles are ungated and are the slack this stream uses when a gate is not ready |

---

## The cross-stream gates

Each is mutual (W-3): the utility needs the library finished, and the library's
dogfood cycle needs the utility written **and used**.

| Gate | Needs | Blocks | Expected around |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nitpick-posix` 0.5 — `grep` | `nitpick-regex` closed | `nitpick-regex` 0.14 | s1 unit 16 ↔ s3 unit 17 |
| `nitpick-posix` 0.7 — `date`, `crontab` | `nitpick-time` closed | `nitpick-time` 0.7 | s2 unit 10 ↔ s3 unit 19 |
| `nitpick-posix` 0.11 — `awk` | `nitpick-parse` **and** `nitpick-regex` closed | — | s2 unit 25 ↔ s3 unit 23 — **tight; see below** |
| `nitpick-logview` | `nitpick-tui` closed, `nitpick-regex` closed | `nitpick-tui` 0.15 | s1, internal |
| `nitpick-conflint` | `nitpick-parse` closed | `nitpick-parse` 0.12 | s2, internal |

**The one tight gate.** `awk` wants `nparse` at about the moment stream 2 is
still finishing it. If stream 3 arrives first it takes `nitpick-posix` 0.12
(terminal, archive, compare) out of order — it is ungated — and returns to
`awk` after. W-9 is the rule; this is the case it was written for.

## Compiler dependencies

Nothing here blocks implementation. Recorded so that a stream reaching its
hardening cycle knows what it is waiting for. The ids are the workbench
registry's ([`meta/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`](meta/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md) §"For the
compiler"), because `O-N` numbers are per repository and collide.

| Compiler | Needed by | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1.5.1 – 1.5.4 (verification surface) | every library's hardening cycle | compiler at 1.5.0 |
| O-N2 (`npkg` builds a library) | retiring six Python harnesses | **not on the compiler's 1.5 or 1.6 map** — a request, not a date |
| O-N1 (`clone_exec` signal mask) | `ntui` 0.1.6, cosmetically | request raised |
| O-N5 (`npkg` multi-artifact) | `nitpick-posix`'s build | request raised |
| ~~O-N6~~ (macro splices a `pick`) | `nitpick-posix`'s **shape** | **ANSWERED 2026-09-03: no.** Probe 02, seven programs. A macro is not shareable across modules at all (`MACRO-007`); `failsafe` is generated instead (PX-100). Shape changed, schedule did not |
