# The record

The orchestrator's execution record (the compiler's R8): what was dispatched,
what came back, what it cost, which estimates were wrong and by how much,
which gates bound, which findings recurred, and every question answered.
Append-only; never rewritten. [`BOARD.md`](BOARD.md) is the present; this is
the past.

## 2026-09-03

- workbench: cycle 0.2 planned and committed (`3f00d7d`); Q-2 answered by the
  author's flagless session (`5e8f464`); the first flagless `/npk:check` run
  found the check skill's control missing and a second writer in the
  workbench — both folded into the plan (`e6a94a7`)
- 0.2.0 executed in the author's planning session, named on the board as the
  workbench writer. Toolchain edits, one commit per repository:
  `nitpick-tui` e5439ee · `nitpick-parse` 3cad08c · `nitpick-regex` c056ae1 ·
  `nitpick-sockets` d385991 · `nitpick-time` aad6e45 · `nitpick-posix` 948d9b6
- finding: the "Where you are" bullet of every `0.0.0.md` also pointed at the
  compiler's `build/` ("whichever is current"); edited with the §2 command.
  `nitpick-posix/CLAUDE.md` had no build section, so it gained "The toolchain"
- 0.2.1 done: the worker skill rewritten for delegation from the workbench;
  `check_record.py` with an 11-case control; the reference check's promised
  control now exists, 7 cases. Both controls green on first run
- 0.2.2 done: the orchestrate skill carries the loop, the stop list, the
  dispatch template, the pin, recovery and escalation; `START.md` is one line
  plus arguments
- 0.2.3 done: the research skill, the currency table in planning and
  auditing, the first research request written for the POSIX edition (Q-1)
- 0.2.4 in progress: five agent definitions written; their live tests
  (names, skill preload, web tools, the auditor's inability to write, nesting,
  and 0.2.2's dry read) wait for a fresh session in the workbench
- 0.2.5 done: the guard scopes on the project directory, follows `cd`
  anywhere, enforces claims and the workbench writer; 73 cases, 29 ms a call.
  Two design findings: the board is the lock and must stay writable, and the
  hook's session id is the UUID, not the cloud id. The board's writer line
  was rewritten once through the interpreter hole to recover from the
  lockout the first rule caused — recorded here so it is never a precedent
- 0.2.6 in progress: the compaction hook with a 4-case control, the workbench
  `CLAUDE.md`, the README current; the live compaction test waits for the
  author's session. Remaining for the cycle: the live tests of 0.2.4 and
  0.2.6, then 0.2.7's dry runs
- writer takeover: `19afbe0e-419e-49e5-86db-c4d8260e417a` → `0a61670c-03a4-47dd-a063-44fd216c25b5`
  at 17:11. The planning session ended with everything committed (`02d4f61`);
  this session, started in the workbench with the plugin loaded from the
  symlink, continues 0.2.4's live tests, 0.2.6's compaction test and 0.2.7.
  Taken by the orchestrate skill's §2 procedure: the board is the lock
- pin 950bb1d: compiler 1.5.0 closed (`950bb1d`), LLVM 20.1.2,
  `.internal/toolchain/950bb1d/`, `sha256sum -c` OK. Made at 17:12 by the
  orchestrate skill's startup, run as 0.2.4's test 6 (the dry read): the
  startup ran through the picture and stopped before dispatch, because
  0.2.7 §1 wants 0.2.4 and 0.2.6 closed before the first worker
